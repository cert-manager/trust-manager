# trust-manager

This branch contains a new Helm chart version for the old "cert-manager-trust" chart which was used before the rename to "trust-manager".

The intent is that users installing using the old chart name should see warnings and deprecation notices telling them to use the new name.

It should also ensure that the ArtifactHub listings for the old chart are clear that the old name is to be avoided.
