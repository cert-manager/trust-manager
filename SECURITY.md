# Vulnerability Reporting Process

Security is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you've found
a vulnerability in `trust`, or in any cert-manager project, please follow the
[vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
documented in the main cert-manager repository.
